4) Privacy policy & legal guidance (summary of useful sources)

- Use a generator or template and customize for your app. Recommended services: Iubenda, TermsFeed, Termly, PrivacyPolicies.com. These generators can produce GDPR/CCPA-compliant policies and host them for you.
- Apple requires a privacy policy link for App Store apps regardless of data collection; Google Play also requires a privacy policy if your app handles personal data or targets certain APIs.

Useful references found while researching:
- Google Play icon & asset specs (developer.android.com).
- App Store screenshot & icon guidance (developer.apple.com).
- Privacy policy template generators: Iubenda, TermsFeed, Termly, PrivacyPolicies.com.

5) Next steps you can ask me to do (I can do now):
- Replace the mockup placeholders with real screenshots (if you upload them).
- Generate pixel-perfect Play Store feature graphic and icons (SVG/PNG) based on your logo.
- Customize the privacy policy further to reflect specific SDKs (Firebase, AdMob) or analytics you use.
- Provide an HTML-hostable contact form backed by a static-friendly service (Formspree / Netlify Forms) instead of mailto.
